        At Cashiu App, we take the privacy of our users very seriously. As part of our commitment
        to transparency and user control, we have established a data deletion policy that allows
        users to request the deletion of their data from our systems.
        <br />
        <br />
        To request the deletion of your data, please submit a request through email at
        <a href="mailto:contact@appchaching.com" class="text-red-500 font-medium">contact@appchaching.com</a>
        with your name, Google email address which you used to login, and Reason for deletion of
        your data.
        <br />
        <br />
        Once we receive your request, we will review it and process it as quickly as possible.
        Please note that some data may not be able to be deleted immediately due to technical
        limitations or legal obligations, but we will make every effort to fulfill your request
        within a reasonable timeframe.
        <br />
        <br />

        deletion of your data, please contact us at
